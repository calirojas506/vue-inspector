# vue-inspector 0.4.3
Vue.js Inspector for Mobile Devices


![](/images/header.png)

## What is vue-inspector?
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/vue-inspector.png?compact=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/vue-inspector)

**vue-inspector** is a basic inspector for Vue.js that works with mobile devices. It could work in a desktop environment, but I do not recommend that; use **Vue.js devtools** instead.

With **vue-inspector** is possible to execute JavaScript code directly in your mobile browser and get error messages generated at run-time. Also inspect the data, props, router links, views/components, computed properties, routes, Vuex and more... inside your Vue.js project.

## Features
- Works with Vue.js 2
- Reactive _(of course)_
- Routes, data, Vuex and computed properties inspection
- Integrated JavaScript _(basic)_ console for code execution and messages/errors logging
- Navigation inside components and their children _(with inspection)_
- Responsive and simple UI
- Supports vue-router

## Installing vue-inspector via Yarn or npm

## Using vue-inspector from jsDelivr CDN

```

CSS:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-inspector@0.4.3/dist/css/vue-inspector.min.css">
```
## How to use vue-inspector?
Install using npm or Yarn, then add **vue-inspector** _(CSS and JavaScript files)_ to your project. Last step is adding the **&lt;vue-inspector/&gt;** component inside your app wrapper _(**el**)_.

```html
<div id="app">
  <!-- add the component to your view -->
  <vue-inspector :hide-lines="true"/>
</div>
```
Make sure **vue-inspector** is the last component added.

If you're having issues with the installation, please see any of the available demos in this repository. Currently **vue-inspector** does not support Nuxt, but I'm working on it :)

## Properties
The following properties are available _(all of them are Boolean and optional)_:

|Property|Type|Required|Default value|Description|
|--------|----|--------|-------------|-----------|
|is-visible|Boolean|false|true|Start visible|
|is-minimized|Boolean|false|false|Start minimized|
|hide-vuex|Boolean|false|false|Hide **Vuex** tab from UI|
|hide-components|Boolean|false|false|Hide **Components** tab from UI|
|hide-router|Boolean|false|false|Hide **Router** tab from UI|
|hide-lines|Boolean|false|false|Hide separator lines _(keeping this option in false improves readability)_|

If you hide any of the tabs _(Components, Vuex or Router)_ the console will be shown by default. The console can not be hidden or disabled.

## Demos
All the demos are available for download from this repository. Clone the repository or download the folder **demos**. Also, I've uploaded them to a temporary free hosting account which you can access with your mobile device:

- [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/calirojas506/full/baqLxb/)

**webpack users:** the property **assetsPublicPath** _(in config/index.js)_ was changed to '/vue-inspector/demos/webpack[-vuex]/'. Only for build. It's because I'm deploying the demo to a different directory instead server's root.
